## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned that I can use margin auto to center an element that spans multiple grid rows or columns. I also figured out that the best workflow for retroactively adding breakpoints is to make sure that I add media queries in order of pixel width (assuming queries are using min-width condition). This makes it easier to reason about which styles are being applied when.


### Continued development

I'd like to try my hand at utilizing Javascript to add funtionality to page.
